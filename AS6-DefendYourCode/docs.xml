						<description>Launcher class's <c>Prompt()</c> method will call an instantiation of 
						InputName, InputInteger, InputFileNameIO, and InputPassword classe's own <c>Prompt()</c>
						methods. These respective methods ask for user input and stores the inputted data into private
						member variables in those classes.</description>

					<term>Write Name with Sum and Product to File</term>
						<description>Launcher's <c>WriteResultToFile()</c> method calls up InputFileNameIO's
						<c>WriteTo()</c> method. This method is responsible for opening and writing to the output file the
						user inputted when prompted. This method writes the last name, then first name the user entered,
						followed by the sum and product of the two integers the user entered when prompted.
						This data is written to the beginning of the file moving the rest of the file's contents below this new data.</description>

					<term>Generate Error Log</term>
						<description>Launcher's <c>WriteErrorsToFile()</c> method calls each instantiated class's Errors member variable
						to write the collected errors to a file called error.txt to document running errors. Each new run on the program will
						override the old error data with the new instance's errors.</description>
